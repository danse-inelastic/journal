Pyre History
============

Historically, Pyre was created to bring a degree of order to the complex task of staging large (massively) parallel scientific simulations. Applications support a command-line, serial execution model. Thi has been extended to command-line parallel execution. Most of the procedures for creating serial applications are the same for parallel applications, so learning about serial apps is a good way to get started. With the inception of the DANSE project, the framework has continued to evolve, particularly in regards to web applications such as Opal, which is based on pyre.
