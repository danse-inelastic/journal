Pyre history
============

Historically, pyre was created to bring a degree of order to the complex task of staging large (massively) parallel scientific simulations. Applications support a command-line, serial execution model. Thi has been extended to command-line parallel execution. Most of the procedures for creating serial applications are the same for parallel applications, so learning about serial apps is a good way to get started. 

Pyre 1.0 is being actively developed currently and will soon be ready for general usage.  Upcoming changes include a more seamless inventory, better db support, and many new additions for creating web applications.
