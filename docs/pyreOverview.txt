"formatting" ideas: 
-try using pudge to generate rst documentation from source code
-would rst2odt and associated packages (python-odtwriter) convert odt back to rst?
-get editor access to wikipedia-like danse wiki pages and cut and paste into here directly, or convert to html
-google docs idea using html
-synchronize cacr and danse pyre directories
