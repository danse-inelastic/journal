pyre docs:

explain odb and pml as types of codecs (portmanteau of 'coder-decoder')--talk about where this is in the class diagram

discuss how to configure odb user, system, and local depositories (in pyre.inventory.odb.prefix.py)

discuss how to put in a new codec?

discuss other configurations Curator does...
        # look for an environment variable with additional local directories
        try:
            plist = os.environ["PYTHIA_LOCAL"]
            if plist[0] == '[':
                plist = plist[1:]
            if plist[-1] == ']':
                plist = plist[:-1]
            local += plist.split(',')
        except KeyError:
            pass

        # gain access to the user settings from the command line
        db = registry.extractNode(self._DB_NAME)
(i.e. environment variables and db...)


discuss what happens to your application as it runs (go through code that runs, perhaps as a uml diagram)
-


explain how initdb.py works

have a "Pyre concepts" page (intermediate pyre)...Weaver, Curator (, etc.


*talk about adding this line to your components:
    def _getPrivateDepositoryLocations(self):
        return ['../config']
