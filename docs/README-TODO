 *replace component and application examples with more realistic one...
 ...(maybe translator for simple script application)...maybe mmtk for complete application with components
 *do several more examples highlighting various parts of pyre/opal
 *have a complete example?  or one that can be run online? 
 *get what's his name to do a flash intro to pyre (maybe a composite of various images and some animation...)
 *and a flash intro to vnf




"formatting" ideas: 
-try using pudge to generate rst documentation from source code
-would rst2odt and associated packages (python-odtwriter) convert odt back to rst?
-get editor access to wikipedia-like danse wiki pages and cut and paste into here directly, or convert to html
-google docs idea using html
-how to get emacs support:
