 Projects using pyre
=====================

Serveral sophisticated scientific computing projects
use pyre as the underlying integration framework.
The largest single simulation run to-date facilitated by pyre was performed 
on the US Department of Energy's Nirvana: 1764 processors, 
2.7 mel solid fluid, 256x256x512 fluid, approximately 
3,000 timesteps/24 hours, and approximately 1.5 terabytes of data.

A few projects that user pyre are:

 * `ASCI (Center for Simulation of Dynamic Response of Materials) <http://csdrm.caltech.edu/>`_
 * `PSAAP (Center for the Predictive Modeling and Simulation of High-Energy Density Dynamic Response of Materials) <http://www.psaap.caltech.edu/>`_
 * `CIG (Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics) <http://www.geodynamics.org/cig/>`_
 * `DANSE (Distributed Data Analysis for Neutron Scattering Experiments) <http://danse.us>`_
