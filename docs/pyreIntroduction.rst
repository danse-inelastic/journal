Introduction
==============
 
Pyre is an integration framework for high-performance computing based on `python <http://www.python.org>`_. It is used by :ref:`several scientific computing projects <projects-using-pyre>`. 

As an integration framework, pyre provides developers of scientific computing software with a set of tools. At its core, pyre provides developers :ref:`easy access to specifications of user inputs for computing engines <pyre-inventory>`, :ref:`a decomposition scheme<pyre-component>` to allow constructions of sophisticated computing engines in a layered structure, and :ref:`good debugging support <journal>`. Pyre also provides the following tools:

 * :ref:`Units <pyre-units>`
 * :ref:`Database access <pyre-db>`
 * :ref:`Geometry <pyre-geometry>`
 * :ref:`XML support <pyre-xml>`
 * `Opal: web application builder <http://danse.us/trac/pyre/wiki/Opal>`

Pyre is more than a framework. Pyre is designed and implemented to promote good software development practices; decomposition of large, complex systems to small, managable components; writing reusable data objects, components and services; appropriate applications of software design patterns; and encourages pythonic style.

Pyre is not useful for the development of simple, monolithic applications; but as soon as applications require coupling of complex software engines, pyre can help.
